# Numpy Camera

**Look away! Still in dev**

Simple threaded camera that doesn't need OpenCV.

## Install

```
pip install -U numpy_camera
```

## Usage

```
c = ThreadedCamera((640,480))
c.start()        # starts internal loop
frame = c.read() # numpy array
c.stop()         # stops internal loop
c.join()         # gathers back up the thread
```
